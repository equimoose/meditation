171
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:18,500
by practicing it. Not only these two, one more yard stick to measure the quality of the

172
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:28,980
technique of meditation. The third yard stick, it looks very logical. If I practice, certainly

173
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:37,500
it will give me benefit, it has given benefit for these ten days. But by practicing it, will

174
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:49,940
any being be harmed, will it prove harmful to others? If so, not good. By practicing it,

175
00:29:49,940 --> 00:30:03,180
will it also be beneficial to other beings if so, acceptable. If something is acceptable,

176
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:12,180
by using all these three yard sticks, then an intelligent person, a wise person should

177
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:25,760
have no hesitation to accept it. And a real wise person, when he accepts, she accepts,

178
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:33,680
it will not be acceptance merely at the devotional level, emotional level. It should not be an

179
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:40,680
acceptance merely at the intellectual level. Now the acceptance should be at the actual

180
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:54,320
level, at the level of practice. Then only it will give benefits throughout the life.

181
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:04,440
And one finds that it is acceptable at the actual level, then one surrenders. Ten days

182
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:11,600
ago you surrendered because you were asked to surrender. Without surrendering you would

183
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:19,440
not have been able to give a fair trial to the technique, going back home. When you decide

184
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:27,560
to surrender, it will not be because somebody asked you to surrender. It will be with your

185
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:36,960
own free will. Now you understood, this is the path for me. This is the practice for

186
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:49,040
me. It is so universal, so scientific, so logical and so resultorian oriented. I have

187
00:31:49,040 --> 00:32:00,160
to live this life. So I surrender to Dhamma, not with a time limit. Now the surrender will

188
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:13,440
be with a free will and it will be for the whole life. Whole life I have to live in Dhamma.

189
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:27,660
Dhamma has to become a part of my life. Without Dhamma the life will be purposeless. The

190
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:38,800
life of a human being is a real life of human being if one applies Dhamma in life, practices

191
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:50,720
Dhamma, so one surrenders and tries to live the life of Dhamma, life of Sheila, morality,

192
00:32:50,720 --> 00:33:01,040
life of Samadhi, developing mastery over the mind, life of Panya, developing one's own wisdom

193
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:13,160
to purify the mind, life of Mehta, Karuna, love, compassion, goodwill for all others.

194
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:25,200
One has to live this life. Dhamma is Dhamma only when it is applied in life. A Dhamma

195
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:39,600
of scripture is not Dhamma. A Dhamma in the discourses of the teacher is not Dhamma.

196
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:48,520
The literal meaning of the word Dhamma is Dharati, Dhamma. When you apply it because

197
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:59,480
you apply it, so it is Dhamma. If it is not applied in life, if one does not practice Dhamma,

198
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:08,520
one may keep on playing emotional games, devotional games, intellectual games. Throughout the life one

199
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:20,440
will not get any benefit. It will be mere waste of time, waste of life. The practical aspect

200
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:31,400
of Dhamma, this alone gives benefit and you attended this 10 day schools to learn the

201
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:41,400
practical aspect of Dhamma. How to apply Dhamma in life? This is what you had been doing

202
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:52,800.0000000002328
last 10 days from morning 4, 4, 30 till 9, 9, 9, 30, you are working, working. Where is

203
00:34:52,800.0000000002328 --> 00:35:07,240
the life of a Shailah, who is very diligently practicing samadhi and very wisely developing

204
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:20,700
your panya and purifying your mind, all practical. If it was only an intellectual game, then not

205
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:36,180
necessary to join a 10 days prison like this. You could have listened to Dhamma discourses

206
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:43,860
on a audio tape or on a video tape, just staying at your home. Why spend 10 days? Because to

207
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:55,380
learn how to practice it, it is the practical part of Dhamma which is very important. Of course,

208
00:35:55,380 --> 00:36:05,900
every evening they used to be discourse, Dhamma talk for about an hour or so. This was not

209
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:15,220
for intellectual entertainment. This was not to prove the superiority of this particular

210
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:22,980
sect or that particular belief, nothing doing. The Dhamma talk was to explain the technique,

211
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:29,380
how you should practice and why you should practice in this particular way, just to understand

212
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:37,140
it. But when Dhamma talks are given, although they are meant to explain the practical aspect

213
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:46,820
of Dhamma, but intentionally or unintentionally, at times the theoretical aspect of Dhamma

214
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:58,100
comes to life in these Dhamma talks. And at times, someone may have difficulty to accept

215
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:06,380
certain part of the theoretical aspect of Dhamma. Dhamma is universal. Therefore, people

216
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:14,500
keep coming from different sects, from different communities, from different religions, from

217
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:23,760
different beliefs, from different traditions, having different dogmas. They are all welcome.

218
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:31,960
Because Dhamma is Dhamma universal, everyone gets the same benefit. People coming from different

219
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:42,360
backgrounds, sometimes in the first ten days, they have some hesitation to accept certain

220
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:50,600
part of the theoretical aspect of Dhamma. So, for a practical aspect of Dhamma is concerned,

221
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:58,200
I have not come across a single person coming from any community, any country, any tradition,

222
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:10,320
to have any objection, any religion worth the name. Can you tell anything against Celia?

223
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,320
Every religion will ask us to live the life of Celia, to live the life of morality. This

224
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:24,960
is what one is doing here. Any religion worth the name, can not have anything against a practice

225
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:34,680
which makes us master of our own mind. To remain a slave of the mind is so dangerous, so

226
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:44,800
harmful. To develop mastery over the mind and that too, be the object which is universal,

227
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:50,800
the object is respiration, which is not limited to a particular sect or particular religion

228
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:57,080
or particular belief or particular dogma. It truth pertaining to your own self, the breath

229
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:07,560
coming in, the breath going out, nobody ever objects to that. And the practice of Panya develops

230
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:14,920
your own wisdom and see how you are generating negativities and you become miserable. You stop

231
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:22,560
generating negativities, you come out of your misery, your mind becomes pure and pure. Nobody

232
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:30,040
ever objects because again the object is truth pertaining to your own mind and matter,

233
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:39,680
the contact of the two resulting in this sensation or that sensation, natural, universal,

234
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:47,120
not limited to a particular sect, particular community, particular religion. So the practical

235
00:39:47,120 --> 00:39:55,480
aspect of Thamma is always acceptable by everyone but in theory at times some difficulties

236
00:39:55,480 --> 00:40:05,280
arise. So whatever you heard during these 10 days, if anyone of you find a certain aspect

237
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:14,360
of the theory is not acceptable, it doesn't matter, leave it aside. Accept whatever is acceptable.

238
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:21,080
After all, when you realize that what I thought was unacceptable is also acceptable now, then

239
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:27,000
accept it. And even if you don't accept the whole life, it doesn't matter, you not lost

240
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:33,200
anything. Practice is more important. So long as you are practicing Silla, Samadhi,

241
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:42,040
Panya, Silla, Samadhi, Panya, you are practicing them and you get benefit out of it. It is the

242
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:58,480
practical aspect of Thamma, which is of utmost importance. There is a story, a professor,

243
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:08,560
young professor, not matured in life, but very highly educated. A number of alphabets after

244
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:23,320
his name, long tale of alphabets, was travelling by a ship. And in the ship, there was also a

245
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:32,560
sailor, a worker, a very old man, illiterate. Sometimes he will come to the cabin of the

246
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:39,120
professor, listen to his words of wisdom, what an intelligent person, what a learned person,

247
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:46,840
wonderful person. And one day, after some talk when the old man was leaving, the professor

248
00:41:46,840 --> 00:42:01,480
asked him, "Old man, have you studied? Have you studied geology? What is geology, sir? I

249
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,880
don't know. I have not been to any school, I have not been to any college. Please tell me,

250
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:12,640
what is geology? Geology is the science of the earth. Have you studied? No, sir, as I said,

251
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:20,720
I have not studied anything. Oh, old man, so unfortunate, you have not studied geology. You

252
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:26,840
wasted one quarter of your life. The old man very sad, he is a long face, goes out. Such

253
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:31,700
a learned person says, "I have wasted quarter of my life. Certainly, I must have wasted

254
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:38,960
quarter of my life." Next day, when he came, again after long talk, when he was leaving,

255
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:47,840
again the professor asked him, "Old man, have you studied oceanology? What is that, sir?

256
00:42:47,840 --> 00:42:54,520
This science of the ocean, the sea, oh no, sir, I have not studied anything. What an unfortunate

257
00:42:54,520 --> 00:43:01,880
person. You have wasted half of your life. Old man, very sorry, at least wasted half of

258
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:08,280
my life." And third day, again he was questioned, "Old man, have you studied materialology? What

259
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:17,800
is this, sir?" I never heard this name. Science of the wind, the rain, the weather, no, sir,

260
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:23,040
as I said, I have never been to any school or college. I have not studied anything. Old

261
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:29,000
man, you are so unfortunate. You have not studied geology, the science of the earth on which

262
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:34,840
you are living. You have not studied oceanology, the science of the sea on which you travel

263
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:40,040
every day. You have not studied materialology, the science of the wind, the rain, the weather

264
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:47,320
which you encounter every day, very unfortunate. You have wasted three quarter of your life.

265
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:53,360
Old man, very sorry, I wasted three quarter of my life. The next day it was the turn of

266
00:43:53,360 --> 00:44:01,280
the old man. He came running, "Professor, sir, professor, have you studied biology? What

267
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:12,240
is biology? Can you swim, sir, or no old man, I can't swim? I am so sorry, professor, sir.

268
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:22,680
You have wasted all your life. There is a ship right now, and this ship is going to sink.

269
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:27,440
Those who consume, they will reach the shore there. Those who can't swim, I am so sorry

270
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:39,120
for you. Pee me learn all the loges of the world, and we don't learn simology, then what is

271
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:49,240
the use of all these loges? And simology also, if you keep on reading books on simology, and

272
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:54,120
keep on discussing about simology without touching the water, then what is the use of this

273
00:44:54,120 --> 00:45:00,400
simology also? We want us to learn actually how to swim, because we want us to swim the

274
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:08,240
ocean of misery, and these the other shore, free from misery. And this is dhamma. This is

275
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:15,400
the practical aspect of dhamma. This alone gives benefit.

276
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:23,760
Spirituality, intellectualization does not help. Meer, devotionalization does not help. The

277
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:32,560
actual experience, and these 10 days, this is what you are doing. As I said, the practical

278
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:38,600
aspect is of what most importance, but in theory, if you find some difficulty, take it out,

279
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:47,840
or nothing wrong. Again, there is a story in our country, a mother, out of all the love

280
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:58,040
on compassion and good will. Prepared a very delicious dish for the child, very delicious.

281
00:45:58,040 --> 00:46:04,560
We call it a dish of keel, milk pudding, made from very good quality milk, very good quality

282
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:14,720
rice, I am sweet and dry fruits, etc., a very delicious dish was offered to the child. And

283
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:22,960
this is no, I won't take it. Hey, what's wrong? I won't take it. It is not in my plate. My

284
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:29,360
plate is more important. Mother had to give the dish, alright, you are plate. Take it,

285
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:36,360
you are plate. Be happy. Again, it says, no, I won't take. Now it's your plate, why not?

286
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:47,440
Oh, there is a small, black little stone in it. I can't take it. It is not black stone. It

287
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:54,000
has its own taste. It is cardimum. You try it, it is so good. No, I can't take it. It's

288
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,360
black stone in it. There is black stone in it. Poor mother, what she will say. She says,

289
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:06,160
alright, if you think this is black stone, take it out. Enjoy the rest. Later on, when you

290
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:10,960
realize that this is also tasty, then enjoy it later on. But now take it out. Enjoy the

291
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:17,080
rest. The mad child will throw with the whole plate. There was a black stone in it. There

292
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:23,420
was a black stone in it. So don't throw with the entire theoretical aspect of dhamma,

293
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:30,420
whatever you find, black stone, take it out. Enjoy the rest. The mother has given with

294
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:39,420
all the good will, with all the love, with all the compassion. Actually, there is nothing

295
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:45,460
like black stone. But because of the traditions, when come from a particular tradition, when

296
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:55,140
you feel, no, this is not good. First thing, it must be in my play. That means the terminology,

297
00:47:55,140 --> 00:48:02,420
the words must be the same as used in my tradition. Otherwise, I can't accept. Alright, your terminology,

298
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:08,180
dhamma is dhamma. Dhamma is not a matter. So long as you understand the essence of dhamma.

299
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:12,460
And then any difficulty in the theory, take that out and later on you accept it. But the

300
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:19,460
practical aspect, nothing has to be taken out. Silla, samadhi, panya, nothing has to be taken

301
00:48:19,460 --> 00:48:30,660
out. Practicing here for ten days, you took just a very tiny step path, it's very long,

302
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:42,140
that has to be accepted. It's a very long path. A lifetime job, maybe a few more lives. It

303
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:53,340
is a long path. But however long the path may be, the longest path starts with the first step.

304
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:58,220
One was not taken even the first step on the right path. There is no hope for this person

305
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:04,580
to reach the final goal. One was taken even one step on the path. There is every hope, this

306
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:09,980
person will take the second step, the third step, unlike this step by step, step by step,

307
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:17,100
will cover the entire path and this is the goal. You are fortunate, you have taken the first

308
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:24,260
step on the path. And I am sure step by step, step by step, you will keep on marching on

309
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:31,300
the path and this is the final goal. First step is a very tiny step, but very valuable

310
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:39,180
step, very valuable. I don't devalue what you practice here. But the fact has to be

311
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:46,660
accepted that this is a very tiny step on the path and path is very long. It is like you

312
00:49:46,660 --> 00:49:59,020
have planted a seed, a seed planted in a very fertile soil. The soil is fertile, there

313
00:49:59,020 --> 00:50:05,820
is no doubt about that. Otherwise it would not have come to take seed here. You have your own

314
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:13,080
palm is of the past which brought you here. The seed is planted. However good quality the

315
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:22,980
seed may be, however fertile the land may be, yet if proper service is not given to this

316
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:34,940
plant, this seed, one does not get fruits. A small little plant has sprouted out of this

317
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:42,060
seed during these 10 days and now you have to serve it. Like an experienced gardener gives

318
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:49,780
old service to small nursery. This is a small nursery now. You have to keep a fence around

319
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:56,420
it so that a kettle may not come and eat it away. You have to give proper water at proper

320
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:04,420
time, proper sun shade, proper sun at proper time so that it grows. It grows, it grows,

321
00:51:04,420 --> 00:51:16,620
it will grow in a huge tree with thick trunk, deep roots, then it will not require any service.

322
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:27,140
No gardener takes care of a huge tree with thick roots, deep roots and thick trunk, not necessary.

323
00:51:27,140 --> 00:51:33,740
On the other hand this very tree which took so much service starts giving us now whatever

324
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:41,140
it produces, it produces for us. All the flowers, the fruits, the shade, everything is for us.

325
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:52,540
Similarly this tiny little plant of dhamma which has sprouted out during these 10 days, you

326
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:59,620
have to take great care of it at the initial stage. You have to keep a fence around it so

327
00:51:59,620 --> 00:52:05,580
that the kettle may not come and eat it away. You have to give proper water at time, proper

328
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:15,780
time. All the service necessary and when it grows into a huge tree then no service necessary.

329
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:24,420
It will start serving you in every aspect, every way. What fence? Which kettle will come

330
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:33,820
and eat it away. Going back home you will meet your relatives, your friends, members of

331
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:39,340
your community, of your society and certainly out of inquisitiveness they ask you where

332
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:46,180
you went. What you did? And dhamma is your open book no secrecy. You will tell I did this,

333
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:53,180
I did this, I practiced this, I practiced this and someone a very confused person will

334
00:52:53,180 --> 00:53:01,780
say, "Oh, but this is not our religion, this is not our religion." It is so dangerous to

335
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:07,620
practice somebody else's religion, but a die in your own religion, then practice somebody

336
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:15,580
else's religion and you will get frightened and you stop meditation. Oh, the kettle is

337
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:24,700
eaten away, eaten away the plant corn. You keep a fence. What fence? You tell this person,

338
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:30,900
"Well, look, whatever I am practicing is within this fence, not beyond the fence." And

339
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:36,700
within the fence is Srilai, morality. If I live the life of morality, what abduction

340
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:44,060
you have got? How I am harming you or how I am harming the tradition? No, no harm. Within

341
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:49,940
the fence is Samadhi, I am trying to be master of my own mind, I trying to concentrate my mind

342
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:56,340
with the help of respiration. What abduction? There can't be any abduction. Within the fence

343
00:53:56,340 --> 00:54:03,140
is Panya, wisdom to eradicate impurities of the mind, to come out of the complexes at the

344
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:09,540
deepest level of the mind. What abduction? And within this fence is developing the good

345
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:16,580
qualities of love, compassion, good will, service to others, selfless service. What abduction?

346
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:25,460
Nobody can object. Your plant is saved. No kettle is eaten up and it will keep on growing,

347
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:31,260
growing. But you have to water it every day, every day, morning and evening, one hour

348
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:41,820
in the morning, one hour in the evening, minimum. You have to water it. A new student sometimes

349
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:48,900
feels very hesitant. Two hours of my day, I am such a busy person, how can I spare two hours

350
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:59,620
of your day or know this is too much? Initially, it looks too much. It is not too much. For the

351
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:08,060
first one year, you have to take a very strong aditthan, strong decision. Let me lose anything

352
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:13,820
at the mundane level, I don't care. But I will practice every day, morning and evening,

353
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:21,060
one hour, one hour. And you won't lose anything. This is only to have a strong decision, aditthan.

354
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:27,940
Initial difficulties will be there. Like coming to a course on the fourth day, you are given

355
00:55:27,940 --> 00:55:35,620
a ditthan. For one hour, you don't change your position, your posture. So much difficult.

356
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:41,140
I am practicing, practicing within ten days. You start sitting easily. So also, initially,

357
00:55:41,140 --> 00:55:46,060
you will have difficulty. How to spare one hour in the morning, one hour in the evening?

358
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:51,780
But having this strong determination within one year, you find it becomes so easy. And

359
00:55:51,780 --> 00:56:00,140
after that, it becomes so easy in life. It won't take even one year to realize that it is so

360
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:08,340
easy. You will start understanding that I am not wasting two hours of my life, two hours

361
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:18,660
of my day, every day. Your capacity to work will increase. Your time given to sleep will

362
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:25,100
decrease. Those who are accustomed to sleep say eight hour every night will now seven hour

363
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:30,300
enough. Those who sleep seven hours, they will find six hours enough. Those who sleep six

364
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:35,820
hours will find five hours enough, not necessary. So one hour, you can easily take out of your

365
00:56:35,820 --> 00:56:43,380
sleep. And even when you get awakened, are you really awakened? Lying here, lazy lying

366
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:49,780
there, lazy so much time is wasted in that, with a Vipassana, for a Vipassana, meditate. Every

367
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:55,220
moment is so valuable. Can't afford to waste time. You will be active. As soon as you wake

368
00:56:55,220 --> 00:57:00,140
up, you are active with your responsibilities, with your daily responsibilities. And the

369
00:57:00,140 --> 00:57:07,620
capacity will certainly increase. Anyone in any profession, any means of livelihood will

370
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:15,180
find that the capacity to workers increase so much. Before practicing Vipassana, if one

371
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:24,500
used to work eight hours per day, at the end of eight hours one felt so exhausted, so tired.

372
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:29,700
Practicing Vipassana morning and evening. Whatever work one used to finish in eight hours,

373
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:35,380
now it is over in seven hours and six hours. And yet feels so fresh, feels like working

374
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:47,620
more, the capacity increases. Case of my own teacher, Siaji Ubhakin, a wonderful person.

375
00:57:47,620 --> 00:57:54,980
One Burma became independent. He was made the first accountant general of Burma. He was

376
00:57:54,980 --> 00:58:02,060
born in a very poor family. The family had no money to give him higher education. He just

377
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:09,060
had education of high school. And then started doing service here and there. Got a very junior

378
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:18,300
clerks job in the accountant general's office. And by his hard work, perseverance, he reached

379
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:25,260
a certain stage. A junior officer, one Burma became independent. And naturally independent

380
00:58:25,260 --> 00:58:30,420
Burma's government wanted their own nationals to be heads of different departments. And most

381
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:37,660
of the departments were headed by Britishers or Indians, etc. In the accountant general's

382
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:42,700
office, they found this person, Ubhakin, although a very junior officer. He was the only Burma's

383
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:52,140
officer, so they made him the accountant general. The first accountant general of Burma.

384
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:59,100
Before he reached that stage, he had started practicing Vipassana. When he was a junior clerk,

385
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:05,000
he heard that on the other bank of the river, there is a teacher, a farmer who is teaching

386
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:13,660
Vipassana. Anybody who has got seed of Vipassana from the past, a seed of Dhamma from the past,

387
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:20,300
cannot resist. Aslam is one here, Vipassana. Oh, it is for me. I better go and try. I better

388
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:27,640
go and try. And this is started happening in him. I must go and try. This is wonderful.

389
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:33,080
But the high officials won't give him ten days leave. They say, "This is the time of budget.

390
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:37,680
Every staff is needed so much. So badly, we can't give you leave." And he says, "But I have

391
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:43,520
to go. You even cut my salary for ten days. No, nothing doing. You can't go. If you go,

392
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:52,120
you will be dismissed from the service. You can't resist. Event. Event away. After ten days,

393
00:59:52,120 --> 00:59:59,080
because of his past parmes, he reached such giddy heights in Vipassana. But it is so much.

394
00:59:59,080 --> 01:00:06,720
But when he came back, there was a doubt that perhaps he will be dismissed, came to the office,

395
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:14,560
and yes, on his table, there was the envelope, official envelope. He opened it. And this message

396
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:20,440
says that you are promoted. Now you have become the superintendent of the office, chief

397
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:27,600
superintendent. Your salary goes fifty percent high. This does not mean that everyone who

398
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:36,320
come here will get a letter of promotion going to the office. Who knows? There are cases.

399
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:41,120
People keep on writing me that after coming back from the course, "I got this, I got that,

400
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:45,400
but this is not a guarantee. It happens in different cases." It happened in the case of

401
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:49,800
who came back in, and then he kept on getting promotion after promotion, he became accountant

402
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:57,880
general of Arman. And the accountant general's office, like many other offices, a lot of corruption,

403
01:00:57,880 --> 01:01:05,160
a lot of bribery. People who are to take their legitimate money from the government and

404
01:01:05,160 --> 01:01:12,680
the application is filed there. Certain percentage was deducted and was distributed right from

405
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:18,800
the attorney general to the accountant general to the peon. There are so good at accounts.

406
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:25,680
So they know what proportion who should get. Now, Uba Ken is accountant general, such a

407
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:34,800
dhamma person, not possible. And he was a very strict disciplinarian. He issued an order

408
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:43,680
that any application comes to the office. The concerned person must give a decision within

409
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:49,640
48 hours. If there is a complication, one cannot take a decision, bring it to me. I will

410
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:57,400
take a decision. One is not taking a decision, not bringing the case to me, has bad intentions.

411
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:06,800
You will be dismissed. But that alone did not work. It was dhamma. In his office itself,

412
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:12,360
he started teaching Vipashana. He went to the prime minister and told him, sir, you made

413
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:18,200
me accountant general good. But look, there is so much corruption everywhere. And unless

414
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:26,320
people practice Vipashana, they can't live a real moral life, a good life. Permit me to

415
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:34,760
have one room where a few workers of this office, every month, take a course of 10 days. The

416
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:41,520
prime minister was also a very good dhamma person. He wanted the administration to become

417
01:02:41,520 --> 01:02:47,520
very pure good. He said, all right, go ahead. And every month there is a 10 day Vipashana

418
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:54,400
course in the office of accountant general. And that started giving result. In a few years

419
01:02:54,400 --> 01:02:58,680
time, it was a talk of the town that in accountant general office, there is no more bribery, no

420
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:07,080
more corruption. And the prime minister called Subhakan. How is it? But is it good or bad?

421
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:12,280
It's very good to back in. But I want this to happen in other ministries, other departments.

422
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:17,840
Look, that department, this department, sir, I am a civil servant. You transfer me there.

423
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:23,440
I will start working the same thing there also. Oh no, no. If I transfer you somewhere,

424
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:28,000
then again this department will sink. So you'll be here. And at the same time, you look

425
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:35,720
after this. You look after that. It was a time when he was head of four departments. So huge

426
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:44,880
responsibility. And yet, kept on working so smileyly, giving wonderful results everywhere.

427
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:51,080
It was said about him that in whichever department he will go for one hour or two hours or five

428
01:03:51,080 --> 01:03:57,680
hours. And any number of files that will come, any number of cases that will come on his table,

429
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:02,440
when he leaves that office, not a single case is there on the table. He gives decision

430
01:04:02,440 --> 01:04:10,120
on every case. However complicated it may be. The mind becomes so clean. Any problem, you

431
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:16,760
can go to the depth of the problem and give a quick result and write result. The capacity

432
01:04:16,760 --> 01:04:25,760
increases manifold, manifold. One works so much. The person that does not make one inactive,

433
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:33,200
one becomes so active, capacitive to work so much. People keep on asking me that this teaching

434
01:04:33,200 --> 01:04:39,080
is not to crave, not to have attachment. Without craving, without attachment, how can

435
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:44,120
you work? How can anybody work? People work because they crave. People work because

436
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:51,280
they have got attachment. Oh, because you have not learned how to work in a detached way.

437
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:55,800
When you are attached, you are so tensed inside. You are so self-centered. I am working for

438
01:04:55,800 --> 01:05:03,440
me, for me, for me. And once you become detached, all tension goes away. Now you work. All

439
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:08,000
those you work for your own livelihood, for those who depend on you to serve them. But

440
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:13,520
then a bigger outlook is there. What am I am working? I am working for others also. Look

441
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:18,160
so many people are getting benefited. So many people are getting, your mind is not narrow

442
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:26,280
now. It is so broad. Capacity to work. Increases all the tensions go away. Mind is so clear.

443
01:05:26,280 --> 01:05:33,000
So tranquil. You make good decisions, right decisions, quick decisions. If this happened

444
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:39,920
only in one person, Ubaghin, perhaps people will say that it was some miracle. It happens

445
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:46,240
to so many. Students keep on writing me. My own experience is there. And students keep

446
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:51,760
on writing me that when I started practicing Vipashana everyday morning and evening, the

447
01:05:51,760 --> 01:05:58,440
results of my profession are coming so good. I live such a peaceful life, such a harmonious

448
01:05:58,440 --> 01:06:05,320
life. And I am so successful in my mundane life also. The mind is for both mundane as

449
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:12,400
well as supreme mundane. Therefore, giving one hour in the morning and one hour in the

450
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:19,600
evening, you are not wasting your time. For first year, all those who live practicing Vipashana

451
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:25,960
daily, they lived during the first year. Those who maintain for the first year, they maintain

452
01:06:25,960 --> 01:06:31,280
easily for the whole life. That is why I say, have with Adityan, a strong determination

453
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:38,280
for one year, whatever happens, I will practice morning and evening. Any time that suits

454
01:06:38,280 --> 01:06:49,120
you, which is suitable to your daily program, stick to that, it will be helpful. Any place

455
01:06:49,120 --> 01:06:57,640
that suits you, stick to that. On that place, maybe just two feet by two feet, you are

456
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:02,680
sitting, you sit and meditate. No other activity should be done there except Vipashana.

457
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:07,520
Then you will grow vibration there. Later on, you will start feeling good vibration where

458
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:12,560
you daily meditate on the same seed. Like you get good vibration coming to a center like

459
01:07:12,560 --> 01:07:17,000
this, where people only meditate Vipashana and no other activity. Similarly, in your house

460
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:21,480
also, if you have a place where no other activity is going on, just meditation and meditation

461
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:27,040
also, pure Vipashana and nothing else, I did, you start getting very good Vipashana there.

462
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:35,440
Same time, same place is very helpful, but it is not absolutely essential. Being householder,

463
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:39,440
sometimes you may be traveling, you cannot have the same place, you cannot have the same

464
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:44,320
time, then any time, any place, but don't miss your daily settings of one hour in the

465
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:52,640
morning, one hour in the evening. Besides that, although very little, just five minutes,

466
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:59,240
but I have seen it gives wonderful results when you go to bed. Lying down, close dyes, you

467
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:03,980
feel sensation anywhere, any chah, any chah, any chah, at least five minutes before you

468
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:09,680
sleep. And morning as you wake up, you must wake up and it will become a habit. You will

469
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:13,860
wake up with the awareness of any chah, any chah. You sleep with the awareness of any

470
01:08:13,860 --> 01:08:17,180.00000000046566
chah, any chah, any chah. You wake up with the awareness of any chah, any chah, just

471
01:08:17,180.00000000046566 --> 01:08:23,439.99999999953434
five minutes. Good enough. You will find whole night is made, made mind, the unconscious

472
01:08:23,439.99999999953434 --> 01:08:28,020.00000000046566
mind which keeps on craving, abortion, craving, abortion. Now go to wonderful job, any chah,

473
01:08:28,020.00000000046566 --> 01:08:32,140.00000000046566
any chah, any chah, any chah, whole night will be feeling any chah everywhere. It gives

474
01:08:32,140.00000000046566 --> 01:08:38,420
wonderful results. Don't miss that. Every day, morning and evening, one hour, one hour,

475
01:08:38,420 --> 01:08:44,500
five minutes before bed and five minutes when you are awakened, besides that, wherever

476
01:08:44,500 --> 01:08:52,340
it is possible, wherever in a village, in a neighborhood, in a town, in a city, where

477
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:59,899.9999999995343
you have a few meritators, with personal meritators living together. And you can find a place

478
01:08:59,899.9999999995343 --> 01:09:06,100.00000000046566
where at least once a week you can join together sit and meditate with a person, a joint meditation

479
01:09:06,100.00000000046566 --> 01:09:13,540
once a week is very helpful, but that is possible, wherever it is possible. Say whole week,

480
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:18,779.9999999995343
there was some storm in your life and you could not meditate properly, not even anapana.

481
01:09:18,779.9999999995343 --> 01:09:24,580
You can't feel any sensations, your mind is so unbalanced. And then at the weekend, you

482
01:09:24,580 --> 01:09:30,020.00000000046566
sit with a few dhamma brothers and dhamma sisters, the atmosphere gets charged with the vibration

483
01:09:30,020.00000000046566 --> 01:09:35,020.00000000046566
of a person, and your battery gets charged because of that, and you can practice very well

484
01:09:35,020.00000000046566 --> 01:09:41,140.00000000046566
in the whole week, next week. You are strong enough. So this weekly sitting has given wonderful

485
01:09:41,140.00000000046566 --> 01:09:47,140.00000000046566
results in many cases, but that is wherever it is possible. Those who live near, and if

486
01:09:47,140.00000000046566 --> 01:09:52,020.00000000046566
they can afford, they can come to a center like this. Those people who live near the center,

487
01:09:52,020.00000000046566 --> 01:10:03,220
they take advantage of the center. Besides this, again unavoidable, is a ten days retreat

488
01:10:03,220 --> 01:10:09,900
every year. If you really want to get a stab list on the path, if you really want to see

489
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:18,180
good fruits of it in your daily life, that once a year, a retreat of ten days is absolutely

490
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:26,380
essential. You can join a camp like this, wherever there is a center, or wherever other

491
01:10:26,380 --> 01:10:31,940
camps are being organized. You don't have such a facility, you are leaving somewhere

492
01:10:31,940 --> 01:10:38,140
far. Then you can have your own self-course for ten days. Now you know the technique very

493
01:10:38,140 --> 01:10:44,020
simple. Just have a room where you can live secluded from others, and they must be somebody

494
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:50,220
who can give you a morning break fast and 11 o'clock meal. On the same timetable, the same

495
01:10:50,220 --> 01:10:59,420
procedure, the same technique, you start. You take a few intriple jam, take eight perceived

496
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:07,140
concepts, observe them, and three to three and a half days anapana, and then be passionate.

497
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:15,100
If you inform your teacher, you are died a few weeks ahead, good, but if you are not informed,

498
01:11:15,100 --> 01:11:21,120
it doesn't matter. After all, what the teacher does. Even now, a teacher or a assistant

499
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:28,300
teacher, when they ask you to sit in front of you, there is no hypnotism, nothing doing.

500
01:11:28,300 --> 01:11:34,540
But you learn to study, method. First, they will practice the same as they ask you to practice.

501
01:11:34,540 --> 01:11:40,500
And then they start generating method. May you be successful. May you come out of your misery.

502
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:46,940
May you not be disturbed by any bad vibration around this method, this love, this compassion,

503
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:51,980
and the vibration of method can reach anywhere, how far you are. So the teacher will just give

504
01:11:51,980 --> 01:11:59,100
you a method to solve. But even if you have not informed, you will be getting method, because

505
01:11:59,100 --> 01:12:07,180
love nature is such. Love nature is such. Every moment when you are generating a vibration

506
01:12:07,180 --> 01:12:14,860
of craving, aversion, ignorance, then all such vibrations in the world, you get tuned up

507
01:12:14,860 --> 01:12:20,420
with that. You start getting support from those vibrations and you are craving, become stronger,

508
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:23,740
you are, aversion becomes stronger, you are ignorance becomes stronger, because you are tuned

509
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:30,300
up with that kind of vibration. But when you practice with a person, you get moments, when

510
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:36,540
you generate vibrations which are anti craving, anti aversion, anti ignorance, then you get

511
01:12:36,540 --> 01:12:42,180
tuned up with such vibrations throughout the universe. The saints of the past are present,

512
01:12:42,180 --> 01:12:46,340
those who practice with a person are, you get in contact with their vibration and that

513
01:12:46,340 --> 01:12:55,700
vibration starts supporting you. The dhamma starts helping, provided you work in dhamma.

514
01:12:55,700 --> 01:13:03,100
If you don't practice properly, then you can't expect the results. These things which are

515
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:09,620
least, minimum and are most essential, morning and evening, one hour, one hour, five minutes

516
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:17,220
and morning, early morning, five minutes, wherever possible, one hour weekly, but ten days

517
01:13:17,220 --> 01:13:23,780
every year must. But more than that, if one gets more time, there is no restriction, more

518
01:13:23,780 --> 01:13:29,500
time. When you are busy with your daily responsibilities, in your profession, in your livelihood, whole

519
01:13:29,500 --> 01:13:34,340
attention must be on your work. This is your anapana, this is your V-person, all attention

520
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:39,020
on your work, so that you get good result in your work, in your mundane field. But whenever

521
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:46,380
you are free, even during your daily work, you find that five, ten minutes you got no work,

522
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:51,660
alright, you are relaxing, open eyes, your mind inside, and itch, and itch, and itch, if you

523
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:56,660
become very fresh and again, start working. Or somewhere you have to wait, wait, maybe

524
01:13:56,660 --> 01:14:00,420
half an hour or one hour you got no work, and if you are not a good person, you are ready

525
01:14:00,420 --> 01:14:06,460
to start boiling, why you have to wait here, and is a negative, and instead of that, you

526
01:14:06,460 --> 01:14:10,780
say, be happy, if you have to wait, have to wait, alright, I got this opportunity now, Anisha,

527
01:14:10,780 --> 01:14:18,100
Anisha, Anisha, you remain so calm, so tranquil, so balanced. Make use of time, whenever

528
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:23,380
you find you are free, practice with your personal, whenever you find your busy, then be with

529
01:14:23,380 --> 01:14:30,180
your work to get good results. Like this, although you have taken a ten day course in the

530
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:34,180
year, and you find you got another holiday, five days are there, take a short course, five

531
01:14:34,180 --> 01:14:40,240
days course. People come to such centers for two day courses weekends, they come Friday,

532
01:14:40,240 --> 01:14:46,100
evening, and go Monday morning, they worked here, they get benefit out of it. So make use

533
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:55,340
of your time, human life is such a valuable life, why valuable? Because to purify the mind,

534
01:14:55,340 --> 01:15:02,780
to liberate the mind from all the impurities, this can be done only by a human being, nature

535
01:15:02,780 --> 01:15:08,060
has given this wonderful faculty only to human being. What you have started doing, observing

536
01:15:08,060 --> 01:15:13,420
the reality inside, making an analytical study of mind and matter, understanding how the

537
01:15:13,420 --> 01:15:17,660
misery arises, the defilement arises, how it tries to overpower you, how you can come

538
01:15:17,660 --> 01:15:25,380
out of it, this kind of work a animal cannot do, a bird cannot do, a reptile cannot do,

539
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:31,180
an insect cannot do. A human being has been given this facility, this faculty by the

540
01:15:31,180 --> 01:15:35,740
nature, or you want to call the God Almighty, and if you don't use this wonderful faculty

541
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:41,060
given to you, then there is no difference between a human life or a non-human life, makes no

542
01:15:41,060 --> 01:15:47,020
difference. You have to make use of the human life by using this wonderful faculty of self-observation,

543
01:15:47,020 --> 01:15:51,660
truth observation, and coming out of all the miseries. So whenever you are busy in your

544
01:15:51,660 --> 01:15:56,580
mundane life as a family person, then you give all your attention to that, but whenever

545
01:15:56,580 --> 01:16:03,140
you have time, give attention to this process of purification, process of liberation.

546
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:08,260
Daily sittings, when you take a short course of five days or two days and one-third of the

547
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:14,460
period must be given to Anapana and two-third to Vipashana, but in your daily sittings,

548
01:16:14,460 --> 01:16:19,020
just one hour is there, morning one hour, evening one hour, not necessary to give one-third

549
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:26,140
to Anapana and two-third to Vipashana. Vipashana will remain the main technique, but Anapana

550
01:16:26,140 --> 01:16:35,060
should be used as and when necessary, as much as necessary. Any day when you sit for meditation

551
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:40,180
and you find your mind is very agitated, then do Anapana. Practice Anapana, five minutes,

552
01:16:40,180 --> 01:16:44,060
ten minutes, fifteen minutes. If it is very agitated, maybe a whole hour, it doesn't

553
01:16:44,060 --> 01:16:49,100
matter. Next sitting will be alright. Make use of Anapana, whenever it is necessary. You

554
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:54,460
started your Vipashana very well in the midst of the hour, some storm arose and again you

555
01:16:54,460 --> 01:17:00,700
need Anapana, start Anapana. So Anapana should be used as and when necessary, but otherwise

556
01:17:00,700 --> 01:17:06,660
we personal. When you practice Vipashana, I keep on reminding, don't start playing games

557
01:17:06,660 --> 01:17:14,460
of sensation. Otherwise you are going in totally opposite direction. If you get pleasant

558
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:18,900
sensation, a free flow when you feel very illiterate because of that, you start generating

559
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:24,020
craving and clinging towards it. If you get again gross sensation and pleasant sensation,

560
01:17:24,020 --> 01:17:30,340
you generate aversion towards it, then it is not Vipashana. It is totally against Vipashana.

561
01:17:30,340 --> 01:17:39,340
Understand whatever arises, keep on understanding its characteristic is Anisha. I have to come out

562
01:17:39,340 --> 01:17:43,620
of the old habit of craving. I have to come out of the old habit of aversion, not merely

563
01:17:43,620 --> 01:17:48,080
at the surface level of the mind, not merely at the intellectual level. I have to come

564
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:52,500
out of it at the deepest level of the mind, which is called the unconscious mind, which

565
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:56,820
keeps on feeling the sensations and keeps on reacting with craving and aversion. This is

566
01:17:56,820 --> 01:18:04,460
what I have to break. And if I multiply the same habit, I am not getting benefit of Vipashana,

567
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:09,340
it is not Vipashana. If you keep on understanding that, you will practice properly and you will

568
01:18:09,340 --> 01:18:16,660
get good results. And also see that your practice every day should not become mechanical, moving

569
01:18:16,660 --> 01:18:20,780
from head to feet and feet to head, like you count your rosary and you forget what is

570
01:18:20,780 --> 01:18:26,140
what you are doing. This should not become mechanical. Whenever you find it is becoming mechanical

571
01:18:26,140 --> 01:18:30,660
and you are forgetting everything about Anisha or everything about your craving, aversion

572
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:36,380
or equanimity, then change a little. Come back to Anapana. If you are moving fast, start

573
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:40,860
moving slow, if you are moving slow, start moving fast, start moving this way, this way,

574
01:18:40,860 --> 01:18:46,500
come out of the monotony. And don't allow it to become mechanical. The main purpose should

575
01:18:46,500 --> 01:18:52,340
always be clear in your mind that I am doing this exercise every day, morning and evening

576
01:18:52,340 --> 01:18:58,540
to change the habit pattern of my life. When I remain slay of this habit pattern and I keep

577
01:18:58,540 --> 01:19:05,940
on generating craving aversion, craving aversion, it is a big misery for me, very big misery. I have

578
01:19:05,940 --> 01:19:11,500
to come out of my misery. And when I become miserable, I make others miserable. So I should

579
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:17,020
not become an instrument to make others miserable. So that point should be very clear that I am

580
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:21,900
practicing this not as a right or a ritual or a religious ceremony, nothing doing. This

581
01:19:21,900 --> 01:19:29,140
is a mental exercise. As we do physical exercise to keep our body fit, sound, healthy, strong.

582
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:35,020
So this is a mental exercise to keep the mind healthy, strong, sound with this understanding.

583
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:42,020
Keep on practicing and get best fruits of thumb. A wonderful thumb, a wonderful technique you've

584
01:19:42,020 --> 01:19:48,700
got now. Make use of it. And see that you not only retain it, you multiply, you grow in

585
01:19:48,700 --> 01:19:57,100
thumb, grow in thumb. There is a story back in our country. Last 10 days you have been hearing

586
01:19:57,100 --> 01:20:03,100
many stories, many listening many stories. Perhaps your teacher is an addict of telling stories

587
01:20:03,100 --> 01:20:13,100
and you are also getting a dick to listen to stories. So before we part one more story,

588
01:20:13,100 --> 01:20:25,100
an old man in our country, very rich man, he became widower, the old lady passed away.

589
01:20:25,100 --> 01:20:33,660
And in our country and perhaps here also the housewife is the owner of everything, money,

590
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:40,180
jewelry, property, everything. She keeps the bunch of the key. Now the old lady has gone

591
01:20:40,180 --> 01:20:44,660
and it was a joint family. He had four sons, so four daughters in law. He can't give this

592
01:20:44,660 --> 01:20:52,380
bunch of key to everyone. He has to choose one. So he calls them, this bunch of key. It will

593
01:20:52,380 --> 01:21:00,340
be given to one who gets highest mark. I will examine you. What examine? He gave five

594
01:21:00,340 --> 01:21:06,940
grains of corn to each five grains, five grains. I will come after four years. You have to

595
01:21:06,940 --> 01:21:12,620
preserve these five grains. One who cannot take care of five grains, how can one take care

596
01:21:12,620 --> 01:21:18,660
of all the money, the jewellery, the granary, etc. This is your examination. The old man went

597
01:21:18,660 --> 01:21:26,740
away. The eldest daughter in law thought, the old man is going crazy. For four years, worried

598
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:31,100
about those five grains, value less five grains, better throw them away. When he comes, I take

599
01:21:31,100 --> 01:21:36,500
another five grains from the granary and give him, take your five grains. She threw away.

600
01:21:36,500 --> 01:21:43,780
The second one thought, yes, it is not good to worry about these five grains for four years.

601
01:21:43,780 --> 01:21:49,380
But who knows? These very five grains, we have some wonderful powers, some magical powers,

602
01:21:49,380 --> 01:21:53,660
some miraculous powers. And after four years, he will say, "All right, eat it." And as I eat

603
01:21:53,660 --> 01:21:58,980
it, I get this supernatural power, that supernatural power. I should not throw away. I better eat

604
01:21:58,980 --> 01:22:06,180
it now. And when he comes, I give another five grains and shade them. The third one, very

605
01:22:06,180 --> 01:22:12,820
eager to get the bunch of the key. So she kept those five grains in a room where she keeps

606
01:22:12,820 --> 01:22:18,260
the statues of her gods and goddesses. And every day she goes and inspects them. So she

607
01:22:18,260 --> 01:22:22,640
goes every day to inspect the five grains also. Took care of the five grains all the four

608
01:22:22,640 --> 01:22:30,780
years. The fourth one, she took the five grains, cleared the land behind the house and planted

609
01:22:30,780 --> 01:22:38,380
them. When time ripened, five plants came out with hundred grains each. And the next season,

610
01:22:38,380 --> 01:22:42,380
all those hundred, five hundred grains were planted. And the next season, all the grains

611
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:50,380
were planted. In four years, tons of grains. When the old man came, everyone had a own story.

612
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:55,900
When he came to the fourth one, he said, "They've increased, sir. Go downs are full. Bring

613
01:22:55,900 --> 01:23:01,620
some laborers to take them." Old man was very happy. This daughter has not only preserved

614
01:23:01,620 --> 01:23:09,620
five grains, she has multiplied, multiplied. This old man has also given five grains of

615
01:23:09,620 --> 01:23:16,820
dhamma, not only preserved them, multiplied, multiplied. And I don't carry away with me,

616
01:23:16,820 --> 01:23:22,500
the bunch of key. It is with you. As you keep on multiplying, multiplying dhamma, you are

617
01:23:22,500 --> 01:23:29,220
able to open the gateory of the kingdom of heaven within and enjoy it. You can open the

618
01:23:29,220 --> 01:23:35,580
gateory of the Brahminic plain within and enjoy the gateory of the nibbhannic piece within

619
01:23:35,580 --> 01:23:42,780
and enjoy it. Keep growing in dhamma, keep growing in dhamma, not to oblige anybody else for

620
01:23:42,780 --> 01:23:48,980
her own good, for her own benefit. And also for the good and benefit of so many others,

621
01:23:48,980 --> 01:23:57,460
so many others. One little thing more, which I don't forget before closing the seminar,

622
01:23:57,460 --> 01:24:03,900
this is of my self-interest and being born in a business family. The tinge of selfishness

623
01:24:03,900 --> 01:24:11,300
does not go. Still there, what self-interest is there. There is a tradition, I believe,

624
01:24:11,300 --> 01:24:14,820
in our country, and I have been hitting hard at many of the traditions, but I don't

625
01:24:14,820 --> 01:24:21,460
hit this particular tradition. I like it very much. The tradition is that if you learn

626
01:24:21,460 --> 01:24:27,780
any art, any technique from any teacher and you don't give proper remineration, we call

627
01:24:27,780 --> 01:24:33,260
it dhaksina, guru dhaksina, you don't give proper fees, proper remineration, that technique

628
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:43,780
will not work for you. I like this very much. This is wonderful. Everyone who comes to

629
01:24:43,780 --> 01:24:50,740
a course just to develop one's own power, me, everyone gives some donation or the other,

630
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:55,780
that is for the coming students, that is for the facility of the coming students, what

631
01:24:55,780 --> 01:25:03,020
the teacher gets and teacher must get something. If fat fees for the fat teacher, what fat fees

632
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:08,980
for a fat teacher? Every day, morning and evening, when you meditate, we push you know, and

633
01:25:08,980 --> 01:25:13,460
at the end of your sitting, when you say, "I share my merits with all." You may remember

634
01:25:13,460 --> 01:25:17,700
me. If you don't remember, it doesn't matter. When you say, "Well, all being share my

635
01:25:17,700 --> 01:25:23,540
merits," may all beings be happy. This is one amongst all beings. And your meta will be

636
01:25:23,540 --> 01:25:29,020
coming to me. This is your fees. Every day, morning and evening, you don't give this

637
01:25:29,020 --> 01:25:37,140
fees to technique, will not work for you. Keep giving your fees, keep giving your fees.

638
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:46,060
Dhamma is so wonderful. Such an invaluable jewel. It is because of somebody good fortune,

639
01:25:46,060 --> 01:25:50,500
because of some very good karma of the past that one gets pure Dhamma. Otherwise in the

640
01:25:50,500 --> 01:25:56,540
name of Dhamma, all the sectarian things, rites, rituals, people are being involved in that

641
01:25:56,540 --> 01:26:00,740
whole life and they feel I am a very religious person, I am a very religious person, when one

642
01:26:00,740 --> 01:26:08,260
does not have a trace of Dhamma. You are fortunate. You have Dhamma now. Make use of it. Keep

643
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:14,100
growing in Dhamma. Keep growing in Dhamma for your good, for your benefit and also for

644
01:26:14,100 --> 01:26:22,220
the good of and benefit of so many others, so many others. Before we close this Dhamma seminar,

645
01:26:22,220 --> 01:26:31,220
we better practice for a few minutes, Smethabhavna. Practice Smethabhavna for a few minutes.

646
01:26:31,220 --> 01:26:57,340
Better share your merits with all beings, whatever merits you have acquired during these 10

647
01:26:57,340 --> 01:27:07,820
days and you acquired enormous merits during these 10 days. Better share these merits with

648
01:27:07,820 --> 01:27:26,620
all beings, all beings. Share your peace and harmony with all beings, all beings. May all

649
01:27:26,620 --> 01:27:47,980
beings be happy. May all beings be peaceful. May all beings be liberated. Liberated. Liberated.
